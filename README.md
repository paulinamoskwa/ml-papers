This is in contrast with previous work on scaling laws for LLMs, which led to a trend of increasing model size without properly scaling the number of training tokens. To validate their analysis, the authors trained a modified version of a huge non-computational-optimal model, *Gopher*, making it smaller (70B params) and training it on more tokens (1.4T tokens): *Chinchilla*. *Chinchilla* outperforms *Gopher*. <br><br>|

The goal is to align a LLM with human preferences. Given a prompt, the LLM produces multiple outputs, and human preferences are collected and used to train a reward model. The reward model is then used as a signal for fine-tuning the initial LLM: when given a prompt and the model's initial output, the prediction of the next token involves the reward model's opinion. This strategy introduces human bias to the text data distribution. Standard LLMs learn to precisely model the distribution of data. In contrast, the RL component here is not doing distribution matching, but mode seeking (identifies and favours the most preferred outputs, rather than capturing the entire distribution of possibilities). The focus on mode seeking sacrifices diversity in exchange of reliable generations. ([*relevant previous work*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325))<br><br>|

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) offers a parameter-efficient alternative by freezing the original weights and introducing a separate set of weights for fine-tuning. These fine-tuning weights are viewed as perturbation of the original weights, ensuring no increase in memory usage during inference. LoRA achieves efficiency by employing low-rank decomposition, representing the new weight matrices as the product of two matrices containing fewer parameters than the original matrix. For a transformer layer represented by weight matrix *W*, LoRA generates a new weight matrix *ΔW* which is then decomposed by lower-rank matrices *A* and *B*. A crucial hyperparameter in LoRA is the rank of the decomposition, *r*: if too low, the fine-tuning won't be efficient, if too high, computational resources may be wasted. <br><br>|

During fine-tuning, the model is trained via repeated gradient updates using a large corpus of example tasks. In contrast, GPT-2 employs single-step training, integrating the task description in the input. GPT-3 builds upon this approach, emphasizing scaling. GPT-3 is still a decoder-only architecture (with way more parameters than GPT-2). It is still trained in a generative way, and then, it is used in a in-context learning framework (as a few shot learner). In-context learning involves presenting examples of desired behaviour directly within the input. Unlike fine-tuning, in-context learning does not update the gradient. GPT-3 exceeded state-of-the-art.<br><br>|

In this framework, the model learns how to map one input text to a target text, regardless of the specific task (translation, summarization, classification, etc). This simplifies the pre-training process as all tasks can be framed as text generation tasks. T5 model architecture is an encoder-decoder transformer. T5 is pre-trained on multiple tasks simultaneously using a unified objective (helps with generalization).<br><br>|

About (4): BERT masks randomly 15% of each sentence, but if the sentence is encountered twice then it'll be masked in the same way. RoBERTa instead implements an on-the-fly mask generation.<br><br>|

GPT-2 introduces a new approach and becomes a zero-shot NLP task model, *i.e.* able to perform specific tasks without a change in architecture nor being trained on particular data. To achieve its generality, GPT-2 is trained to predict *p(output*\|*input, task)* rather than *p(output*\|*input)*. A training sample for translation is `("translate to french", english text, french text)`, and a sample for reading comprehension is `("answer the question", document, question, answer)`. How can this be enough? If the model is trained on enough (diverse) data, it is already implicitly learning a lot of different tasks.<br><br>|

While GPT is decoder-only, BERT relies on transformer's encoder. The attention layer in the encoder is not masked, so each token can attain to all the others (that's why BERT is bidirectional). While GPT is pre-trained in a generative way (predict the next token), BERT is pre-trained on two tasks: predict randomly masked words in the input (15% of tokens are randomly masked), and determine whether a pair of sentences is composed of two subsequent sentences. The loss function for pre-training is the combination of the two losses. Once pre-trained, BERT can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.<br><br>|

Similar to ELMo, GPT generates contextualized word embeddings. However, instead of using bidirectional LSTMs, GPT relies on a stack of transformer decoder blocks, with positional information handled by positional embeddings. The network undergoes unsupervised pre-training, where it learns to generate the next word in a sequence. For supervised fine-tuning, the paper proposes various model architectures (head adaptations).<br><br>|

Promptable segmentation is a new vision task introduced by this paper. SAM is trained on SA-1B, a new 11 million images dataset containing 1 billion segmentation masks. SAM takes as input an image and a prompt, and processes them with two independent encoders. The generated embeddings are then passed to a lightweight mask decoder that outputs three segmentation masks (one single mask creates issues with ambiguous prompts). In addition, SAM predicts also its own confidence score for each mask, *i.e.* what SAM thinks the IoU of the masks with the ground truths will be. This way, SAM is able to also have a confidence for its predictions. The mask with the highest *(true)* IoU with the ground truth is used to compute the loss, which is a combination of focal loss (focus on hard pixels), dice loss (variation of IoU), and MSE (between the actual IoU and the predicted one). <br><br>|

While GLIP teaches the model to associate words with visual regions (language aware object detection), Grounding DINO is a (hybrid) self-supervised algorithm that learns to detect objects without explicit labels. Grounding DINO leverages unlabeled data in the form of image-text pairs. For each `(Image, Text)` pair, image and text features are extracted using separate backbones, and fed into a feature enhancer module for cross-modality feature fusion. A language-guided query selection module selects then the visual features that are more relevant to the input text. These visual features, along with the text features, are fed into a cross-modality decoder. The output queries (attention layers involved) of the latter are enhanced visual features used to predict object boxes.

With a single, fixed architecture, OneFormer is a task-conditioned model for semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation. It is trained only once using a panoptic segmentation dataset, and outperforms models trained individually on each segmentation task. During training, one segmentation task is sampled and passed to the model as text input. Then, the panoptic ground truth is adapted to the sampled task. Inside OneFormer, two sets of queries are created: text queries (text-based representation for segments in the image) and object queries (image features extracted and processed by a transformer). A contrastive loss is used to align the text and object queries, inherently guiding the model to distinguish between tasks. <br><br>|

A diffusion model (U-net) learns the reverse process, moving from gaussian noise back to the original image. This is achieved through incremental steps, with the model taking each time a noisy image as input and producing a less-noisy image as output. How does the text come into play? The text is encoded and concatenated to the input (noisy image) of the denoiser (U-net). Any form of conditioning can be encoded (text, image, etc). In addition to the concatenation, inside the U-net model the attention layers are able to attend to the conditioning tokens. This paper introduces LDMs (Latent Diffusion Models), a way to address the image-size limitation of diffusion models. LDMs first encode the image into a latent space, conduct the whole diffusion and denoising processes inside the latent space, and then decode back the output. <br><br>|
